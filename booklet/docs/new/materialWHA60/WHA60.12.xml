(1) notwithstanding the provisions of Financial Regulation 4.3, the Director-General is authorized to make transfers between the appropriation sections of the effective working budget up to an amount not exceeding 10% of the amount appropriated for the section from which the transfer is made; all such transfers shall be reported in the financial report for the financial period 2008–2009; any other transfers required shall be made and reported in accordance with the provisions of Financial Regulation 4.3;
(2) amounts not exceeding the appropriations voted under paragraph 1 shall be available for the payment of obligations incurred during the financial period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009 in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulations; notwithstanding the provisions of the present paragraph, the Director-General shall limit the obligations to be incurred during the financial period 2008–2009 to sections 1 to 13;
(3) the amount of the contribution to be paid by individual Members shall be reduced by the sum standing to their credit in the Tax Equalization Fund; that reduction shall be adjusted in the case of those Members that require staff members to pay income taxes on their WHO emoluments, taxes which the Organization reimburses to said staff members; the amount of such tax reimbursements is estimated at US$ 11 284 310, resulting in a total assessment on Members of US$ 940 124 310;

3. FURTHER RESOLVES that:
(1) notwithstanding the provisions of Financial Regulation 4.3, the Director-General is authorized to make transfers between the appropriation sections of the effective working budget up to an amount not exceeding 10% of the amount appropriated for the section from which the transfer is made; all such transfers shall be reported in the financial report for the financial period 2008–2009; any other transfers required shall be made and reported in accordance with the provisions of Financial Regulation 4.3;
(2) amounts not exceeding the appropriations voted under paragraph 1 shall be available for the payment of obligations incurred during the financial period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009 in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulations; notwithstanding the provisions of the present paragraph, the Director-General shall limit the obligations to be incurred during the financial period 2008–2009 to sections 1 to 13;
(3) the amount of the contribution to be paid by individual Members shall be reduced by the sum standing to their credit in the Tax Equalization Fund; that reduction shall be adjusted in the case of those Members that require staff members to pay income taxes on their WHO emoluments, taxes which the Organization reimburses to said staff members; the amount of such tax reimbursements is estimated at US$ 11 284 310, resulting in a total assessment on Members of US$ 940 124 310;
4. DECIDES that the Working Capital Fund shall remain at the level of US$ 31 000 000, as earlier decided under resolution WHA56.32;
