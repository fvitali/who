                        <p>Increasing international movement of jobs, products and technologies can help to spread innovative solutions for prevention of occupational hazards, but can also lead to a shift of that risk to less advantaged groups. The growing informal economy is often associated with hazardous working conditions and involves such vulnerable groups as children, pregnant women, older persons and migrant workers.</p>

                        <p>The present plan of action deals with all aspects of workers’ health, including primary prevention of occupational hazards, protection and promotion of health at work, employment conditions, and a better response from health systems to workers’ health. It is underpinned by certain common principles. All workers should be able to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and favourable working conditions. The workplace should not be detrimental to health and well-being. Primary prevention of occupational health hazards should be given priority. All components of health systems should be involved in an integrated response to the specific health needs of working populations. The workplace can also serve as a setting for delivery of other essential public-health interventions, and for health promotion. Activities related to workers’ health should be planned, implemented and evaluated with a view to reducing inequalities in workers’ health within and between countries. Workers and employers and their representatives should also participate in such activities.</p>

Actions 5. The following actions are to be considered and adapted by countries, as appropriate, to their national priorities and specific circumstances in order to achieve the objectives described below.
Objective 1: to devise and implement policy instruments on workers’ health 6. National policy frameworks for workers’ health should be formulated taking account of the relevant international labour conventions and should include: enactment of legislation; establishment of mechanisms for intersectoral coordination of activities; funding and resource mobilization for protection and promotion of workers’ health; strengthening of the role and capacities of ministries of health; and integration of objectives and actions for workers’ health into national health strategies.
